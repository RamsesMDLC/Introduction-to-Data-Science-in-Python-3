#MORE DATA PROCESSING WITH PANDAS

#We will deepen our understanding of the Python Pandas library by learning:
    #How to merge DataFrames
    #Generate summary tables
    #Group data into logical pieces
    #Manipulate dates. 
    #Scales of data
    #Creating metrics for analysis. 
    
#Topic 1.1:Merging Dataframes (Theory)
import pandas as pd

#In this lecture we're going to address how you can bring multiple dataframe...
#...objects together, either by merging them horizontally, or by concatenating...
#:.. them vertically. 

#Relational theory (Venn Diagram)
    #A Venn Diagram is traditionally used to show set membership. 
        #For example: the circle on the left is the population of students...
        #...at a university. The circle on the right is the population of...
        #...staff at a university. And the overlapping region in the middle...
        #...are all of those students who are also staff. 
        
    #When we translate this situation (Venn Diagram) to Pandas, we can think...
    #...that we have these two populations as indices (maybe with the label...
    #...of Person Name) in separate DataFrames, . 
    #If we want a list of all the people regardless of whether...
    #...they're staff or student, and all of the information we can get on...
    #...them:
        #In database terminology, this is called a "full outer join",...
        #In set theory, it's called a "union".
        #In the Venn diagram, "it represents everyone in any circle."

    #If we want a list of all the people that are both staff or student...
    #..., and all of the information we can get on them:
        #In database terminology, this is called a "inner join",...
        #In set theory, it's called a "intersection".
        #In the Venn diagram, "it represents overlapping parts of each circle"

#Topic 1.2:Merging Dataframes (Practice)     
# First we create two DataFrames (staff and students). 
    #In this case we are going to create a staffÂ´s DataFrame.

staff2_df = staff_df.copy()

    # And lets index these staff by name.
staff_df = staff_df.set_index('Name')

    # Now we'll create a student dataframe

#Topic 1.10: Concatenation (Theory)

#Merging: is join "horizontally" the dataframes, meaning we join on similar...

#Concatenating: is join "vertically" the dataframes, meaning we put dataframes...
#... on top or at the bottom of each other.

    #For instance: We have a dataset that tracks some information over the...
    #...years. And each year's record is a separate CSV and every CSV for...
    #...every year's record has the exactly same columns. We can concatenate them.

        #If we are concatenating two dataframes that do not have identical...
        #...columns, and choose the "inner method", then some observations...
        #...(rows) will be dropped due to NaN values (in other words, we are...
        #...going to see as final result only the columns in common;...

#The main objective of "Method Chaining" is to apply several functions or...

#...condensed in a "statement of code").

    #The "statement of code" can be identify be parenthesis that which tells...
    #...python I'm going to span the statement over multiple lines).

    #REMEMBER[ dropna() ]:
        #It is Panda dataframe code.
        
        #Allow us to remove the rows and columns with Null and NaN values or...
        #...that do not follow certain parameter.
        
        #If we don't want the "NaN" data, we use them "dropna() function". The...
        #...returned DataFrame now has all of the "NaN" rows dropped. 
        
        #We can use the function ".dropna()", which is able to drop all of... those...
        #...rows which have any missing data (i.e. this function will eliminate...
        #...from the dataframe all the rows that have missing data. One way to...
        #...see this in a esay way is to look the values of the index and then....
        #...see the gaps).
        
        #The syntax is: dropna(self, axis=0, how="any", thresh=None, subset=None, inplace=False)
            #axis: possible values are {0 or âindexâ, 1 or âcolumnsâ},...
            #...default 0. If 0, drop rows with null values. If 1, drop...
            #...columns with missing values.
            #how: possible values are {âanyâ, âallâ}, default âanyâ. If âanyâ,..
            #...drop the row/column if any of the values is null. If âallâ,...
            #...drop the row/column if all the values of every cell are missing.
            #thresh: an int value to specify the threshold for the drop operation.
            #subset: specifies the rows/columns to look for null values.

#Topic 3.1: GroupBy (Split)

#MAIN CONCEPT #1 

#GroupBy it is such a powerful weapon. in fact, SQL the language has been a...
#...standard tool for advanced data analysts for decades before pandas appeared. 

#If we want to get more info about the data (deep flavor of them) we...
#...need to apply more than just simple "aggregations" of Pandas and Numpy.

#For instance, "aggregations" of Pandas are the followings:

#...count() Total number of items
#...first(), last() First and last item
#...mean(), median() Mean and median
#...min(), max() Minimum and maximum
#...std(), var() Standard deviation and Variance
#...mad() Mean absolute deviation
#...prod() Product of all items
#...sum() Sum of all items

#Therefore, in this case we can apply the concept of "split, apply and combine".

    #The "split step" involves breaking up and grouping a DataFrame depending...
    #...on the value of the specified key.
    
        #Using "Groupby" code.

    #The "apply step" involves computing some function, usually an "aggregate,...
    #...transformation, "apply" or filtering", within the individual groups.

        #Aggregation: do some statistical calculations
        
        #Applyï¼ do some data conversion
        
        #Transformation: do some data processing transformation
        
        #Filtration: do some group level filtering

    #The combine step merges the results of these operations into an output...
    #...array.
    
        #Using concatenation "concat" code.
    
#MAIN CONCEPT #2

#Notice that what is returned  after apply a "Groupby" code is not a...
#..."DataFrames", but a "DataFrameGroupBy" object (this object is a...
#...special view of the DataFrame, which is poised to dig into the groups...
#...but does no actual computation until the aggregation or function is applied.

#Topic 3.1: Splitting

#The main concept is that we can select and...
#...extract a piece of the dataframe and then play with that (i.e. applying...
#...some code or function or method to that piece of data) with the Pandas...
#...function "groupBy()", after that, combines the results back together into...
#...another dataframe (In Pandas this is refered to as the "split-apply-...
#...combine pattern")

    #This topic is very useful because we avoid to apply the code or function...
    #...or method to all the dataframe, when we are really interested only...
    #...in analyzed a piece of the dataframe.

    #...average.

    #...magic function %%timeit

#Topic 4: Applying 

#The Pandas developers have 3 broad categories of data processing (i.e. operations)...
#...to happen during the apply step and available by a "GroupBy" code:
    #1- Aggregation of group data
    #2- Transformation of group data
    #3- Filtration of group data

#Topic 4: Aggregation 

#It is the most straight forward of data processing during the apply step.

#Uses the operation "agg()" on the groupby() object. 
    #It is important to say that we are invoking the agg() function on that...
    #...object, therefore we can see round parentheses after the word "agg".
    
    #The "agg()" function is going to apply one or more "functions" we specify...
    #...to the group dataframes and return a single row per dataframe grouped...
    #...in this case "cancellation_policy" is the dataframe/group ("agg()"...
    #...returns a single value per column, so one row per group).
    
        #Note that the "functions" {located inside the "agg()" functions}...
        #...are not function invocations, or function names, they are...
        #...references to functions which will return single values.

#Thus far we have only iterated through the groupby object, unpacking it...
#...into a label (the group name) and a dataframe. {this is important because...
#...in the previous steps [all Topic 3] we work with the data and functions...
#...in different steps and not in the same line of code}.
                 
#But with the groupby method "agg()" we can pass in a dictionary the...
#...following elements:
    #the columns we are interested in the "agg()" code. 
    #the function we are looking to apply to the column inside in the agg() code.
    
#It is important to say that we are only interested to print and show (the...
#...results will be in a heirarchical index [i.e. alphabetically if the index...
#...are formed by string or in descending order if the index are number]) 
#...a small part of the dataframe through groupby() the values of the column...
#..."cancellation_policy" (it is printed as an index, set as a default according...
#...to REMEMBER[ groupby() ]) and related with the "average values" of the...
#...column "review_scores_value".
    #In other words we are creating a groupby() on the dataframe object by the...
    #..column "cancellation_policy". In other words it is still a dataframe...
    #...(smaller tha the original).

print ("Topic 4.1:","\n", df466)

    #In this instance we get as a printed result a table with "NaN values" in...
    #...the column "review_scores_value", because in every group of data of...
    #...the column "cancellation_policy" (flexible, moderate, strict,...
    #...super_strict_30) have related "NaN values" in the column...
    #..."review_scores_value" and that altered the function "np.average"...
    #...(because "np.average" does not ignore "NaN values").
    
    #To fix the error in the function "np.average" described in the previous...
    #...comment we use the function "np.nanmean" {Compute the standard...
    #...deviation along the specified axis, while ignoring NaNs}.

    #Even:
        #We can use more than one function (per column) at the same time...
        #...inside the agg() code. In this case we use a "tuple of functions":
            #Compute the standard deviation {np.nanstd} along the specified...
            #...axis, while ignoring NaNs.
        #We can have more than one column inside the agg() code {each column....

print ("Topic 4.3:","\n", df488)  
print("\n") 

#Topic 5: Transformation

#Uses the operation "transform()" on the groupby() object. 
    #This is different from "agg() function" because as an answer after...
    #...apply the "transform()" code we get an object (new entire serie or...
    #...dataframe) of the same size of the original dataframe (from which...
    #...is applied the group) based in the size of the column or...
    #...columns selected to group and as a consequence making...
    #...easy to combine in the future this result with the original dataframe...
    #...due to they have the same shape.
        #In other words, if we groupby "cancellation_policy" (flexible,...
        #...moderate, strict, super_strict_30), we are applying a function....
        #...through "transform()" code in every element of the grouped serie...
        #...or dataframe getting multiple values per column (of the selected...
        #...column or columns) and multiple values per row in each groupby().
        
    #In the case of "agg() function" we get only a single value per column (of...
    #...the selected column or columns) so one row per groupby().
    
    #While aggregation must return a reduced version of the data,...
    #...transformation can return some transformed version of the full data...
    #...to recombine. For such a transformation, the output is the same shape...
    #..as the input.
    
# First, lets define just some subset of columns (that belong to the original...
#...dataframe) we are interested in:
    #In this case the first column listed is the column which are designed to...
    #...be grouped and then following columns are those on which we are...
    #...are going to apply some function.

#Option #1: Now lets transform it. I'll store this in its own dataframe.

    #...rows of that belongs to the column "review_scores_value" of this...
    #...category; therefore, if we have 5 categories, we are going to see...
    #...only 5 mean unique values (each one por category) repetead several...

#Option #2: Now lets transform it. I'll store this in its own Serie.

    #..of the Option #1 with a better and readeable code.

    #...tranformed values to the original dataframe through a new column.

#Topic 6: Filtering

#It works like a simple filter. First, we create a function and then we apply...
#...this function through the "groupby" code in the original dataframe and as...
#...result we are going to get a dataframe with only the data that accomplish...
#...the requisites of the function (it means that some of the rows of the....
#....original dataframe will be dropped because after the function application...
#...they do not meet the requisites).

    #The filter() function takes in a function which it applies to each group...
    #...dataframe and returns the values that are True (meet the requisites)...

print ("Topic 6.1:","\n", df54)  
print("\n")

#Topic 7: Apply

# By far the most common operation invoked on groupby objects is the...
#..."apply()" function. This allows us to apply an arbitrary function to...
#...a group, and put the results back for that "apply()" into a single
# dataframe where the index is preserved.

#It is important to say that Using apply can be slower than using some of...
#...the specialized functions, especially "agg()". But, if our dataframes..
#...are not huge, it's a solid general purpose approach.

#...it will be a two step process:
    #First we used on the groupby object.
    #Then we had to create anew column. 
    
#To solve this process we can use "apply()" which could wrap this logic in...
#...just a single line.
    #First: we create a function that compute the mean value of the...
    #..."review_scores_value" and then create the new colum that will show...
    #...the difference between of "review_scores_value" and the "mean value....
    #...of review_scores_value".

    #...are going to apply the function "calc_mean_review_scores") is the...
    #...dataframe in which we are applying the code "grouped by" (in this...

#Categorical Data
    #"Categoricals" are a Pandas data type.
    
    #A "Categorical variable" takes on a limited,...
    #....and usually fixed, number of possible values (categories). Examples:..
    #...are gender, social class, blood type, country affiliation,...
    #...observation, time or rating.
    
    #"Categorical" data...
    #...might have an order (e.g. âstrongly agreeâ vs âagreeâ or âfirst...
    #...observationâ vs. âsecond observationâ), but numerical operations...
    #...(additions, divisions, â¦) are not possible.
    
    #Order is defined by the order of categories, not lexical order of the...
    #..values. 
    
    #The categorical data type is useful in the following cases:
        #A string variable consisting of only a few different values....
        #...Converting such a string variable to a categorical variable...
        #...will save some memory.
        
        #The lexical order of a variable is not the same as the logical...
        #...order (âoneâ, âtwoâ, âthreeâ). By converting to a categorical...
        #...and specifying an order on the categories, sorting and min/max...
        #...will use the logical order instead of the lexical order.

#We create a dataframe of letter grades in descending order.

#The main concept is that if we have several categories we can create a filter...

#...criteria for the "ranges" is established bu the user) or also called bins.

    # Now if we just want to make "bins" of each of these, we can use the...
    #...code "cut()".    
       #There are other methods. For instance, "cut()" gives you interval...
       #...data, where the spacing between each category is equal sized....
       #...But sometimes you want to form categories based on frequency...

       #...instead of the spacing between bins.

#1.0.1 Question 1 <--WINNER (Option without function)

#Story:

#First: Load the energy data from the ï¬le Energy Indicators.xls, which is...
#...a list of indicators of energy supply and renewable electricity...
#...production from the United Nations for the year 2013, and should be put...
#...into a DataFrame with the variable name of energy. Keep in mind that...
#...this is an Excel ï¬le, and not a comma separated values ï¬le. Also,...
#...make sure to exclude the footer and header information from...
#...the dataï¬le.

#Second: The ï¬rst two columns are unneccessary, so you should get...
#...rid of them, and you should change the column labels so that the columns...
#...are: [ â Country â , â Energy Supply â , â Energy Supply per Capita â ,...
#...â % Renewable â ].

#Third: Convert Energy Supply to gigajoules (there are 1,000,000 gigajoules..
#...in a petajoule). 

#Fourth: For all countries which have missing data (e.g. data with "...")...
#...make sure this is reï¬ected as np.NaN values.

#Fifth: Rename the following list of countries (for use in later questions):...
#..."Republic of Korea": "South Korea", "United States of America":...
#..."United States", "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland":..
#..."United Kingdom", "China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region":...
#..."Hong Kong".

#Sixth: There are also several countries with numbers and/or parenthesis...
#...in their name. Be sure to remove these, e.g.â Bolivia (Plurinational...
#...State of) â should be â Bolivia â ,â Switzerland17 â should be...
#...â Switzerland â .

#First:
#I read the file MS Excel File (xls format), then I skip (delete) certain...
#...number of rows with the code "skiprows" (header; in this case the first...
#...17 rows of the file) and also skip (delete) certain number of rows with...
#...the code "skipfooter" (footer; in this case the last 38 rows of the file).

   #Extremely Important: some MS Excel files can be in (xls format) or in...
   #...(xlsx format), which depends on the version of MS Excel file.
   
   #Extremely Important: the header can affect the opening of the file and as...
   #...consequence it is highly likely that we are going to get an error...
   #...message if we do no control this situation.

energy = pd.read_excel("Energy Indicators.xls", skiprows = 17, skipfooter= 38)
print(energy)

#Second:
#I drop the first two columns (useless) of my dataframe an establish in the...
#...code that those changes be reflected in the actual dataframe.

#Then, I changed the name of all the columns.

#Fourth: For all countries which have missing data (e.g. data with "...")...
#...I changed those cells to "np.nan" values.
    #Although is a Numpy code, it can be used in the Panda environment.
    #"NaN" is short for "Not a number". It is used to represent entries...
    #...that are undefined or missing values in a dataset.
    #The concept of NaN existed even before Python was created. 
    #"NaN" is a special floating-point value which cannot be converted to...
    #...any other type than float.
    
    #The Option #1 
        #The Main advantage is that it does not care about in what part...
        #...(specific index) of a certain column of the dataframe is...
        #...located the data that we want to fix or change.

#Create a column that estimates the number of citable documents per person....
#...What is the correlation between the number of citable documents per...
#...capita and the energy supply per capita? Use the .corr() method,...
#...(Pearsonâs correlation).

#This function should return a single number.

#(Optional: Use the built-in function plot9() to visualize the relationship...
#...between Energy Supply per Capita vs. Citable docs per Capita)

#Story:
    #1.I just took the same function "1.0.1 Question 1 (Part 1)".
    #2.After that, I create a new column called "Population", which is a...
    #...division between the columns ["Energy Supply"] / ["Energy Supply per Capita"]
    #3.After that, I create a new column called "Citable per Person", which...
    #...is adivision between the columns ["Citable documents"] / ["Population"]
    #4.Then I apply the "Correlation Method" (the same of HMLSL) to all the...
    #...data (the columns) of the dataframe, getting as an answer a matrix...
    #...with columns as columns and as rows and as diagonal all values are 1.
        #It is important to say that we get through this code the value of...
        #...the "Pearson correlation coefficient" , also called "Standard...
        #...correlation coefficient". In addition we have the code (Final...
        #...Comment) to check the correlation between atributes through a...
        #...amtrix graph.
        
    #5.Finally, I print only the value of the cell that contain the...
    #...Correlation value between 'Citable per Person' and "Energy Supply...

#Create a new column with a 1 if the countryâs % Renewable value is at or...

#This function should return a series named HighRenew whose index is the...
#...country name sorted in ascending order of rank.

#Story:
    #1.I just took the same function "1.0.1 Question 1 (Part 1)".
    #2.After that, I found the mean value of all values shown in the column...
    #...of ["% Renewable"]
    #3.Then I replace the value "np.nan" in the dataframe (but with the...
    #...purpose to work over the column ["% Renewable"]) for the value of...
    #4.Then I create a blank list.
    #5.I create a for loop to move in every row of the column ["% Renewable"]...
    #...to find those values "under the mean, above the mean and equal to mean"...
    #...an then put those values equal to "0,1 or np.nan". Afterwards...
    #...those values are append to the list created in the step 4.
    #6.I convert the list in a Serie and added (manually) the country names...
    #...as index.
    #7.Finally I sort the Index of the Serie.


#Ideas Extras (to try in another moment):
    #Do the "if process" of indentify values considering a type of data (type...
    #..."float" for the "nan" and "int" the "numbers"?
    #Play with the index when we think about merge dataframes together...
    #...or a Series together.
    #Apply the code "apply" or "filter" or "transformation" or "aggregation"....
    #...as a way to a apply a function over a dataframe (i.e. over column or...
    #...columns of a dataframe).
    #Use of Lambda as a function inside of "apply" or "filter" or...
    #..."transformation" or "aggregation".
    #Create a specific function that will work inside the code "apply" or...
    #..."filter" or "transformation" or "aggregation"
    #Review codes of Week 1 and 2 to check some posible answer.
    #Review in the web some code to a apply a function over a dataframe (i.e...

#1.1.11 Question 13 (6.6%)  <--WINNER (Option with function)

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re

#Convert the Population Estimate series to a string with thousands separator...
#...(using commas). Do not round the results.
#e.g. 317615384.61538464 -> 317,615,384.61538464

#This function should return a Series PopEst whose index is the country name...
#...and whose values are the population estimate string.

#Story:
    #1.I just took the same function "1.0.1 Question 1 (Part 1)".
    #2.After that, I create a new column called "Population", which is a...
    #...division between the columns ["Energy Supply"] / ["Energy Supply per Capita"]
    #3.1.Then I locate the column "" in the dataframe and applied a "map()"...
    #...function over the column "PopEst"
        #Inside "map()" ww put a "function and an iterable", then...
        #..."map()" will create an object. This "object" contains the...
        #...output you would get from running each iterable element through...
        #...the supplied function.
        
        #Map() is iterable, so we can use like a for loop to look at all...
        #...of the values or items in the map(). 
    #3.2.To be specific, the function to apply is a change in...
    #...format of the numbers to a object "string" where thousands...
    #...are separate by commas{:,} (i.e. after this we generate the change...
    #...from one type of variable to another).
        #We can check this if we print the information of the dataframe...
        #..."DataMerge2.info()" before the format transformation (it will...
        #...show us the presence of "15 non-null object", i.e., the presence...
        #...of non-strings) and the description of the serie...
        #..."Series13.describe()" after the format transformation (it will...
        #...show us the presence of "object", i.e., the presence...
        #...of strings).
        
        #Pandas dtype (object) = Python type (str or mixed)
        #Usage = Text or mixed numeric and non-numeric values
                              
        #Pandas dtype (float64) = Python type (float)
        #Usage = 	Floating point numbers                
    #4.I drop all the columns except from "PopEst".
    #5.I create a Serie from the dataframe, selecting to build this Serie...
    #...only the column "PopEst". As a consequence we get a Serie with this....
    #...column and the Serie also have the same index of the dataframe (like...
    #...inheritance).
